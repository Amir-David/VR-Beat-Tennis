VR Beat Tennis is a rhythm-based virtual reality game developed in Unity as the final project for the PROJECT IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS course.

## Game Overview

In VR Beat Tennis, players wield two virtual tennis rackets to hit balls that arrive in sync with the music. The twist? Each ball must be directed into a corresponding basket that appears alongside it, adding an extra layer of challenge and precision to the gameplay.
